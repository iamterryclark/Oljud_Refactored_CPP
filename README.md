#Oljud {Noise}

An Interactive AudioVisual Tool for artists.

##Current Status
This project currently does not run for my work in progress. I have built out all the individual classes instead of PointCloud and a working skeleton tracking.
I have obtained the joints of the skeleton however, unable to display them currently.

##Things I have done
I have refactored most of the code from my original project so this code can be marked based on code readability, techniques I have used etc.

Please ignore: PointCloud.cpp/.h and OSCSend.cpp
